# GIM-Gaming-In-Moderation
This program basically enables you to blacklist certain softwares on Windows inorder to limit their usage/screentime. For example, suppose there is this game you want to play, but you wish to do so in moderation, i.e., limit you game time, than you can add that game to this software and this software will continuously monitor the system if that game process becomes active and after the allocated time runs out, it terminates the game process. Basically a productivity program.
